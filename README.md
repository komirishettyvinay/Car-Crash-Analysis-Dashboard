## Introduction
This Car Crash Analysis Dashboard aims to provide insights into traffic incidents using real-world crash data. It allows users to identify trends, high-risk locations, and contributing factors to crashes, supporting better decision-making for road safety improvements.

## Dashboard Visuals and Descriptions

### V1: Total Crashes
**Description**: This visual displays the total count of crashes recorded in the dataset. It gives a quick overview of the overall frequency of incidents, serving as a foundation for analyzing crash data trends and highlighting the scale of traffic incidents within the studied period.

### V2: Average Crashes
**Description**: This visual shows the average number of crashes occurring over a specific timeframe (e.g., per day, month, or year depending on filter settings). By providing a normalized view, it allows users to assess typical crash rates and identify any deviations from the average that may require further investigation.

### V3: Year Filter (Button)
**Description**: This interactive button lets users filter data by year. By selecting specific years, users can dynamically adjust the entire dashboard to explore and compare annual trends and patterns in crash data.

### V4: Crashes by Weekend vs. Weekday
**Chart Type**: Donut Chart  
**Description**: This visual breaks down crashes by weekend and weekday, allowing users to see if there are significant differences in crash frequency based on the day type. This can reveal patterns like increased crashes over weekends or weekdays, offering insights into how traffic conditions and driver behaviors vary.

### V5: Crashes by Time of Year
**Chart Type**: Line Chart  
**Description**: This line chart shows the distribution of crashes throughout the year by plotting monthly data. By visualizing trends over time, users can identify any seasonal patterns, such as higher crashes in winter months due to weather conditions or increased incidents during peak holiday seasons.

### V6: Reported Location of Crashes
**Chart Type**: ArcGIS Map  
**Description**: This map visual plots each crash's location based on latitude and longitude. By displaying data geographically, users can quickly spot high-risk areas and clusters of incidents, providing a spatial understanding of crash occurrences that may indicate problem areas or zones requiring intervention.

### V7: Crashes by Collision Type
**Chart Type**: Stacked Bar Chart  
**Description**: This visual categorizes and displays crash data by collision type (e.g., 2-Car, 1-Car, 3+ Cars). The stacked bar chart highlights how different collision types contribute to the total number of incidents and allows for a straightforward comparison of each category, identifying the most common collision types.

### V8: Crashes by Collision Type and Primary Factor
**Chart Type**: Pie Chart  
**Description**: This pie chart breaks down crashes by collision type, with each segment further categorized by the primary factor contributing to the crash (e.g., Failure to Yield, Following Too Closely). This visual helps identify the common causes of specific collision types and the proportional contribution of each primary factor to the overall crash data.
